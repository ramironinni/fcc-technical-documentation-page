            <p>The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:</p>
            <p>This code first includes the Node.js http module. Node.js has a fantastic standard library, including
                first-class support for networking.
                <code>The createServer()</code> method of http creates a new HTTP server and returns it.

            <p>Node.js is a low-level platform. In order to make things easy and exciting for developers, thousands of
                libraries were
                built upon Node.js by the community.</p>
            <p>
                Many of those established over time as popular options. Here is a non-comprehensive list of the ones
                worth learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AdonisJs: A full-stack framework highly focused on developer ergonomics, stability, and confidence.
                    Adonis is one of the fastest Node.js web frameworks.
                </li>
                <li>Egg.js: A framework to build better enterprise frameworks and apps with Node.js & Koa.</li>
                <li>Express: It provides one of the most simple yet powerful ways to create a web server. Its minimalist
                    approach, unopinionated, focused on the core features of a server, is key to its success.</li>

            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that was created at Netscape as a scripting tool to manipulate web
                pages inside their browser, <strong>Netscape Navigator.</strong></p>
            <p>Part of the business model of Netscape was to sell Web Servers, which included an environment called
                <em>Netscape LiveWire</em> that could create dynamic pages using server-side JavaScript. Unfortunately,
                Netscape
                LiveWire wasn't very successful and server-side JavaScript wasn't popularized until recently, by the
                introduction of Node.js.

            <header>How to install Node js</header>
            <p>Node.js can be installed in different ways. This post highlights the most common and convenient ones.</p>
            <p>Official packages for all the major platforms are available at <a class="link"
                    href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node page.</a></p>
            <p>One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager. In this case, every operating
                system has its own.</p>
            <p>On macOS, Homebrew is the de-facto standard, and - once installed - allows you to install Node.js very
                easily, by running this command in the CLI:</p>
            <p>
                <code>brew install node</code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="How_much_JavaScript">
            <header>How much JavaScript</header>
            <p>As a beginner, it's hard to get to a point where you are confident enough in your programming abilities.
            </p>
            <p>While learning to code, you might also be confused at where does JavaScript end, and where Node.js
                begins, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>I would recommend you to have a good grasp of the main JavaScript concepts before diving into Node.js:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lexical Structure</li>
                <li>Expressions</li>
                <li>Types</li>
                <li>Variables</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
                <li>this</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform
                APIs like Cookies. Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the <code>document</code>,
                <code>window</code> and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.
            </p>
            <p>In practice, this means that for the time being you use <code>require()</code> in Node.js and
                <code>import</code> in the browser.
            </p>
